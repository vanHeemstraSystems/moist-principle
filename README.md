# M.O.I.S.T. Principle

> The MOIST principles provide a balanced approach to writing code that prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and readability. While the DRY principle focuses on minimizing repetition, MOIST acknowledges the practical need for some redundancy to achieve these goals.

- [References](./REFERENCES.md)

## 100 - Meaningful

> Ensure that the code has purpose and context, even if it means some repetition to enhance clarity.

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

## 200 - Organized

> Keep the code well-structured and easy to navigate, which might involve some necessary redundancy.

See [README.md](./200/README.md)

## 300 - Intentional

> Be deliberate with repetitions, understanding when they serve a functional or communicative purpose.

See [README.md](./300/README.md)

## 400 - Simplified

> Advocating for simplicity and clarity in code design and implementation.

See [README.md](./400/README.md)

## 500 - Transparent

> Make the codeâ€™s intentions clear, even if this means duplicating logic to make it more understandable.

See [README.md](./500/README.md)
